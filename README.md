yet another yuv viewer 

yet another yuv viewer (yay) displays 4:2:0,
4:2:2, 4:0:0 YUV, and Y-only pictures and
sequences (planar Y:U:V format). It tries to find
geometry information such as _widthxheight
somewhere in the path and filename (e.g.
mobile_352x288.yuv or
path/to/yuv/mobile_640x480x400frames/file.yuv).
